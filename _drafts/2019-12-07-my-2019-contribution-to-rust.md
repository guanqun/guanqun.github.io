In the middle of this year, I decided to contribute a little bit to the awesome Rust community by fixing bugs and adding some features to [rust compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and [cargo package manager](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo). Now it's 2019 December, it's a good time to look back and see how I was doing during last a few months. I plan to write one blog for each specific non-trivial issue.

Here's the list:

 - [Add the option to configure ssl version in cargo]()
 - [Fix one ICE in rust]()
