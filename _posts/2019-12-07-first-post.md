I've already been trying to setup a blog to write down some technical thoughts, so finally before the end of 2019, here it is.

This blog might cover various areas depending on my interests at different times.

As a warmup for the syntax, here are some random scratches:

~~~rust
fn main() {
}
~~~

```
$ hello
```

We can use this syntax `main` and note[^haha].
